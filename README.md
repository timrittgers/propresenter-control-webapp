# propresenter-control-webapp

This project is a javascript based web application that utilizes the [Propresenter control api](https://openapi.propresenter.com) in order to connect to and control slide operations.

## How to use this web application

Because this application relies on API calls to the Propresenter network server, this application should be run from a webserver on the same network that is running the Propresenter application. A good solution to run this locally is [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info).

Propresenter must be running and the "Enable network" option should be on in the application network settings.

You will need the Port and IP Address from that screen in order to connect the webapp.
